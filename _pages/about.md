Dr. Fangni Zhang will join the Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering at The University of Hong Kong as an Assistant Professor in February 2020. Prior to this, she held Lecturer positions at University of New South Wales and University of Leeds, and worked at Imperial College London as a Research Associate. Dr. Fangni Zhang’s research covers a wide range of fundamental or emerging issues in transport, including multimodal transport system modelling and optimization, shared and automated transport management, high-speed rail and air transport interactions, and wider economic impacts of transport. Her research draws tools from different disciplines such as network modeling, economic theory, traffic flow theory, operations research, and data science to transport research and has been published in a number of world-leading journals and conferences in the field (e.g., Transportation Research Part A, B, C, D, E).

Research interests
======
- Multimodal transport systems

PhD positions
======
- I am looking for 1-2 self-motivated Ph.D. students to join my research group. Applicants should have a B.S. or M.S. in Industrial Engineering, Transportation Engineering, Economics, Operations Research, Mathematics, and Computer Science or related fields. Strong oral and written communication skills in English are required. Candidates with research experience in network modeling, optimization and game theory are preferred.

- Successful applicants will be considered eligible to receive a Postgraduate Scholarship (the 2019/20 rate: HKD 17,330/month) during the normative study period. Outstanding applicants for the Ph.D. programme are strongly encouraged to apply for the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship scheme, which offers an annual stipend of HKD 25,800 /month plus a conference and research-related travel allowance of HKD 12,900 per year for a period of up to three years. More information regarding HKU Ph.D. scholarships is available at: [https://www.gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees#2](https://www.gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees#2)
