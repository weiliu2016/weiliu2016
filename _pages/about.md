Dr Wei Liu is an Assistant Professor (Lecturer) in Transport Engineering jointly appointed by the School of Computer Science and Engineering and the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UNSW. Prior to his position at UNSW, he was a Lecturer at University of Glasgow, UK, and was a postdoctoral researcher at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, and was a visiting scholar at University of Florida, US. Dr. Liu mainly works in transport system modelling and optimisation; large-scale traffic modelling, simulation and computing; transport economics; and urban big data analytics.
