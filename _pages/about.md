Dr. Wei Liu is a Senior Lecturer and ARC DECRA Fellow in Transport Engineering jointly appointed by the School of Computer Science and Engineering and the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). Prior to joining UNSW, he was a Lecturer at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), UK, and was a postdoctoral researcher at [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland, and was a visiting researcher at the [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/), US. Dr. Liu received his PhD in Transportation from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2014, and his B.Eng. in Civil Engineering and Bachelor of Laws both from Tsinghua University in 2010. Dr. Liu is a recipient of the Discovery Early Career Researcher Award from the Australian Research Council. His research group mainly works in transport system modelling and optimisation; large-scale traffic modelling, simulation and computing; transport economics; and urban big data analytics. He was the winner of The European Transport Innovation Challenge 2017 under European Commission, and received a Best Paper Award from the [International Transportation Economics Association (ITEA)](https://iteaweb.org/) for young scholars in 2015.
